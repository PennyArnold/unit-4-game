Pick a crystal - game of luck

 Deployed site: https://pennyarnold.github.io/unit-4-game/

This a project assignment from University of Texas Coding Bootcamp.  It is an interactive game that requires you to click on crystals to try to reach the random number set by the computer.  Each crystal has a random value that changes each game.  If you click a crystal and exceed the value of the random target number, you lose.  The game tracks wins and losses.  

This game includes HTML, Bootstrap (libray) CSS, Javascript and jQuery (libray).  Files include an index (main) HTML file, and links to Bootstrap and jQuery CDNs.  There is also a link to the javascript file that contains the interactive functions that make the game work.

Please feel free to open the index file and play the game and view the code to see how it is set up to make the game work.
